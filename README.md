Homework assignment for Per Scholas.
Had two days to do this assignment and I made a simple Pokemon Battle Simulator using PokeAPI


Player can roll a random Pokemon and moves, then battle against a computer opponent to see whose move is more powerful


# TUTORIAL:
- Click [Roll Pokemon] to get a random Pokemon
- When you have a Pokemon, click [Roll Move] to get a random attack
- When you have the pokemon and move you like, click [Start Battle] to battle 
- View the battle results in the battle log
- Click [Reset Game] to start over

- Programming principals used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Axios for API requests
- Javascript Modules
- Asynchronous JavaScript (async/await, Promises)


Random API: PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2)
